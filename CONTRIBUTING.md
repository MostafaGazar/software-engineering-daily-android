How to Contribute
-----------------
We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

Getting Started
---------------
We use [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) so instead of a single `master` branch, we use two branches to record the history of the project. The `master` branch stores the official release history, and the `develop` branch serves as an integration branch for features. It's also convenient to tag all commits in the master branch with a version number.

Workflow
--------
If you would like to contribute to this project, please:
- Pick an [issue](https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/software-engineering-daily-android/issues) to work on or create a [proposal](https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/software-engineering-daily-android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#feature-proposals) for a new feature.
- Fork this project.
- Create your feature branch based off the `develop` branch.
- Create a pull request to get your work reviewed and merged back into the upstream `develop` branch.

Please include screenshots of your app changes and write down the test scenarios you followed to verify that your code works.

Feature proposals
-----------------
Please create an issue, label it as a `feature proposal` and follow the following template:
```markdown
# Proposal: [your title here]
